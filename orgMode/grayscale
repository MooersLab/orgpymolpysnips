# name: Apply grayscale coloring using a grayscale version of the PyMOL colors for the elements. This is a Python function. It is invoked in a script file via grayscale(). There is a corresponding gscale shortcut in pymolshortcuts.py that is invoked in a pml script by entering gsale if the functions in pymolshortcuts.py have been loaded with the run pymolshortcuts.py command.
