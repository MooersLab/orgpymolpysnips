# orgpymolpysnips

This project supports the generation of reproducible molecular images using org-mode and PyMOL.
It includes a Yasnippet library of PyMOL code written in Python rather then the PyMOL macro language (pml).
It can be used with Jupyter kernels that can access the Python API of PyMOL.


Work in progress. Check back later.
