# name: Save a png file of current scene to the current directory. PyMOL writes out only png files. This file may need to be converted to a tiff file. See the png2tiff snippet for a bash script that converts all png files in a folder into tiff files. 1: png filename. 2: x-dimension in pixels. 3: y-dimension in pixels, 1600 x 1000 approximates the golden ratio. Usually want a square for multipanel figures..4: dots per inch. 5: ray tracing off, 0; ray tracing on, 1 should also consider image without ray tracing shadows.
